# WebGL Shaded Dice Cube

Welcome to the WebGL Shaded Dice Cube project! This project demonstrates the use of light effects, textures, and interactive user input to create a visually engaging and interactive dice simulation. Follow the instructions below to set up and interact with the dice.

## Getting Started

To run this project locally:

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine.
2. **Navigate to the project directory.**
3. **Start a local server** for this project, we will use:
   - **XAMPP:**
     - Install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) if you haven't already.
     - Start the Apache server from the XAMPP control panel.
     - Place your project directory inside the `htdocs` folder within the XAMPP installation directory (usually `C:\xampp\htdocs`).
     - Navigate to `http://localhost/your_project_directory` in your browser.
4. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` (or the appropriate port if different)

## Features

### Light Effects and Textures

The dice cube uses WebGL to render with realistic light effects. The lighting interacts with the textures applied to each face of the dice, creating a dynamic and visually appealing result.

### Interactive User Input

Control the dice with the following key commands:
- **Toggle Spin:** Press `T`
- **Rotate on X Axis:** Press `X`
- **Rotate on Y Axis:** Press `Y`
- **Rotate on Z Axis:** Press `Z`
- **Spin the Dice:** Press `S`

### Rolling the Dice

To roll the dice, you can:
- Click the "Roll the Dice" button on the interface, or
- Press the key `S`

The dice will spin and stop at a random face, displaying a number between 1 and 6.

## How to Use the Dice

1. Launch the project in your browser by following the steps in the "Getting Started" section.
2. Interact with the dice using the keyboard commands or the on-screen button.
3. Observe the dice spin and enjoy the light and texture effects as it stops on a random number.

### Visual Effects

The colors and appearance of the dice are a result of the combination of light sources and the texture images applied to each face. Each face of the dice has a distinct texture image representing the numbers 1 through 6.

## Conclusion

This project combines the power of WebGL with interactive elements to create a fun and engaging dice simulation. Enjoy exploring the effects and functionality, and feel free to customize and expand upon the code.

Happy coding!
